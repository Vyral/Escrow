Did you miss the class where we shared the five things to take your lead management to the next level?
Kim Hughes, a virtual assistant for top agents all across the country, came to the class and shared
her tips for amping up your lead management.

One of the most important things she covered was having a system for when leads come in. Are you tracking where your leads come from? Do you spend your time and money on those systems that are generating leads, or are you spending money elsewhere? There are different systems to track where the leads originate.

Another thing Kim talked about was communication. Do you have a before, during, and after communication plan? Are you persistently and consistently building deep relationships with your past, current, and future clients by doing things on the web or marketing to your past database?  

Think about this. If you’re a farmer and you plant your crops, you don’t just come
back in six months expecting a harvest. You water them. You fertilize them.
You nurture them. Then you come back and you have an amazing crop.

It’s the same thing with the database. You have to nurture your current database, and you have to “plant” more leads to grow your
database. Kim talks about several ways to keep planting new people and setting a system in place to communicate with them on a high level.

Kim is a virtual assistant, so she can do this for you. If you find yourself doing non-dollar producing activities, find someone to take care of those for you. If you have any other questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
