Did you miss the Agent Mastermind class where we taught how to use Facebook to generate leads, market to an area, and form a neighborhood? Fortunately, I’ll share with you two important takebacks today!

We first talked about how to use a system to create something of value for yours sellers. Imagine this situation. What if you hypothetically walked into a neighborhood with 300 homes all under $500,000? You create a single property site for each of those homes with a postcard, QR codes, text codes, and flyers. You started to introduce yourself with these materials and explain how they’ve helped former clients without a clearly defined call to action. What do you think will happen? That’s something you need to watch for in this class.

Secondly, we talked about how to brand a Facebook page and create a private Facebook group for each neighborhood. It’s endless on this strategy. Because this sounds overwhelming, it’s crucial to get access to that recording and learn what you’re missing out on.
