Did you catch the **Pinterest class where we shared how to connect, engage, and interact with your current and past database?**
<br>
<br>In this class, **we talked about how to get more clicks, likes, and shares, how to get higher user engagement,** and why pinning is so addictive (we all love pictures!). The cool part about the pictures is that you can direct clients who visit your Pinterest page wherever you want them to go, just by putting in the link. Also, did you know that when you pin something on one of your boards, you can automatically have it update on Facebook and Twitter?

"Pinterest lets you share your passions and lets others join."

Pinterest lets you share your passions and lets others join in with you. The coolest part is that you get to share who you are and what you do for a living without really asking for the business. You can share things like the hottest home colors or the 10 steps for a home inspection individually. Go crazy! Pin things like man cave inspiration, best local burger joints - **the ways to involve yourself in your real estate business are endless using Pinterest.**

I hope you made the class! If you didn’t, click the link below to get signed up for future classes and the replays. If you’re a loan officer and have no clue what I’m talking about, click on the “About” section above to find out some more.
