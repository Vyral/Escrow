Today, I have some important reminders I want to share with you! We talked about these tips in our video marketing class, and I think they’re crucial to your success as an entrepreneur.

1. **Send out a reconnect video email.** When you start video marketing, send a message to your database to announce the new project. It’s helpful to point out questions or concerns you’ve received from clients and address them in a video, so information becomes valuable to your consumer audience. This goes for buying or selling a home or whatever service you provide as a professional. Invite viewers to suggest a topic.

2. **Do a tip of the week.** Send out a video each week with an important take back the audience finds useful. This provides a consistent schedule with valuable information for you and your audience alike.

3. **SEO is extremely important.** Your information should be hyper localized, but also search engine optimized. If you’re not a SEO expert, I recommend finding help and consult someone that is. This is especially crucial for someone that’s been creating content for a while without experiencing desired results.

4. **Get videos out there.** Once they’re done and uploaded, get the content out there consistently! Use social media to your advantage. There are people using Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and many more. All these platforms are opportunities to expand your readership and ultimately business.
