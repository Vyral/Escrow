Did you catch my class where I taught you how to stay in front of your past clients, current clients, and future clients for 2-3 hours per day on Facebook? If not, then let me explain again.

I showed you how to setup a custom audience Facebook ad. I want to make sure that you understood how to get your contacts into Facebook so that you can continue sending custom ads and building your list.

Just imagine if your past, current, and future clients saw you on Facebook (the largest social media site in the world) every single day. Do you think you’d have some credibility? NAR says that 86% of consumers would work with you again, but only 7% of people actually follow through and repeat business with that person. Why does this happen? It’s because you have no follow up system.

I consider a custom audience Facebook ad to be extremely valuable if you want to warm your database and get some sales out of it.

If this is your first time joining us, then go to our Facebook page and either sign up or give us a like. I hope to see you at our next class!
